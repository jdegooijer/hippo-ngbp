# Prerequisites
* [Chrome](http://google.chrome.com)
* [gulp-cli](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp-cli) (optional)

The Hippo Build uses [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com) for frontend task automation.
Installing the gulp-cli globally is optional. You can install the gulp-cli
globally via `npm install -g gulp-cli` and use the gulp cli directly, initiate
gulp tasks via `npm run` or simply stick with the predefined `npm start` and
`npm test` described below.

    $ npm install
